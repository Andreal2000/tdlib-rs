# tdlib-rs

This is an improved version of the [tdlib-rs](https://github.com/paper-plane-developers/tdlib-rs) library that not required `pkg-config` as a dependency and has a more flexible way to build the library.

A Rust wrapper around the Telegram Database library. It includes a generator to automatically generate the types and functions from the TDLib's [Type Language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) file.

It's mainly created for using it in the [Telegrand](https://github.com/melix99/telegrand) client, but it should work also for any other Rust project.

Current supported TDLib version: [1.8.19](https://github.com/tdlib/td/commit/2589c3fd46925f5d57e4ec79233cd1bd0f5d0c09).
